## rtc example

### 1 Brief

The main function of this code is to display time by using RTC peripherals.

### 2 Hardware Hookup

The hardware resources used in this experiment are:

- UART0

  - TXD0 - IO43
  - RXD0 - IO44
- XL9555
  - IIC_SCL - IO42
  - IIC_SDA - IO41
  - IIC_INT - IO0(jumper cap connection)
- SPI_LCD
  - CS - IO21
  - SCK - IO12
  - SDA - IO11
  - DC - IO40(jumper cap connection)
  - PWR - XL9555_P13
  - RST - XL9555_P12

The RTC is an internal peripheral, so there is no corresponding connection schematic diagram.

### 3 Running

#### 3.1 Download

If you need to download the code, please refer to the 3.3 Running Offline section in the [Developing With MicroPython tutorial](../../../../1_docs/Developing_With_MicroPython.md), which provides a detailed download process.

#### 3.2 Phenomenon

After normal operation, the spilcd module will display time and date information.
